# ManageMoney
In this solution, I developed a web API that runs on docker composer.
I created a web API Service for managing my money transactions by running on docker. 
I used dot net 0.7 and PostgreSQL in this project.
Iused xUnit Test for testing services.
The project includes below advantages: 
- Create a Dockerfile file describing a simple .NET Core service container. 
- Build, run, and verify the functionality of the service. 
- Debug the service running as a container. 
- To run on docker we need to run the below commands: docker-compose build and docker-compose up
